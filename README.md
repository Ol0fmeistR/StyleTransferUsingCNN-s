# NeuralStyleTransfer
Neural style transfer mostly deals with the training of a convolutional neural network over a dataset to repaint an novel image in the style of a given painting. This is the implementation of Neural Style Transfer from the paper A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style in Keras 1.0.2.
