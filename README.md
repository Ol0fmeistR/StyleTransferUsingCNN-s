### Neural Style Transfer
Neural style transfer mostly deals with the training of a convolutional neural network over a dataset to repaint a novel image in the style of a given painting. This is the implementation of Neural Style Transfer from the paper A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style in Keras 1.0.2. <br>


For the purpose of demonstration, the two images starting from the left were fed to the Neural network and the image on the right was the output:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starry Night Over the Rhone</td>
    <td>Philadelphia City Hall</td>
    <td>Output generated by the network</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
